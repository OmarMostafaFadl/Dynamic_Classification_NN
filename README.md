# Dynamic_Classification_NN
This is a low level (using only numpy) Dynamic Neural Network. It takes a csv labelled data file. The NN learns the size and the number of classes of the problem. It takes a list with the number of layers, number of nodes in each layer needed and an activation function is chosen. Then it trains and outputs an accuracy number on the testing data.
